        <p>Hi, shie. How are you? I hope everything’s going well for you. I’ve wanted to say something for a while, but honestly, I’ve been too shy. The truth is, you feel way out of my league. You’re so beautiful, so amazing, everything about you is perfect I really don’t think I could ever compare.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I know I haven’t made my move yet, and honestly, I don’t even know where to start. Every time I try to chat with you, I freeze in front of my screen, like my mind just goes blank. I don’t know what’s happening I only know that I’m happy whenever we chat. I can’t even think of a topic because, truthfully, I’ve been admiring you so much that nothing else comes to mind. Everything about you makes me happy, and somehow, that’s all I can focus on if you ever read this ediwow:)
