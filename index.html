        <p>Hi, crush. How are you? I hope everything’s going well for you. I’ve wanted to say something for a while, but honestly, I’ve been too shy. The truth is, you feel way out of my league. You’re so beautiful, so amazing, everything about you is perfect I really don’t think I could ever compare.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          But no matter how much I try to ignore it, I can’t hide how much I like you. You’re always on my mind, and every time I see you, I’m just reminded of how special you are. It’s hard to put into words, but there’s something about you that feels almost unreal, like you’re too good for this world if you ever read this ediwow.
